Data Steward 

The individual or group who maintains authority over the collection and use of data. This person or group determines the acceptable business uses of the information, levels of protection needed for the information, and the data classification of the information. This role generally falls to a functional area such as the Registrar, Human Resources, or the CFO. 

Data Manager 

The persons or unit responsible for implementing the controls the Data Steward identifies. This role is often Information Technology or departmental support. 

Data Users 

Any person who interacts with the data – people or programs that can create, update, read, or delete information. 

Protected Data 

Any information classified as Sensitive or restricted by the University of Akron Data Classification Standard. 

 

Purpose 

All users of Information Technology will interact with data while performing their jobs at the University of Akron. Generally, data will be considered Public, Sensitive, or Restricted and require certain procedures and standards for access and storage. It is the responsibility of the University of Akron to implement these procedures and standards to help users protect their data. 

Certain statutes and regulations may require additional standards and procedures beyond the basic data handling guidelines for each classification. Examples of these statutes and regulations include: 

FERPA 

HIPPA 

PCI-DSS 

Research involving CUI 

 

Scope 

This standard applies to all data collected, stored or processed by University staff or by third parties via contractual agreements with University departments or other organizational groups. 

 

Standards 

Data and Risk Classifications 

To assist in handling multiple forms of data, the University has defined three levels of data classification: Public, Sensitive, and Restricted. Each level of classification represents a specific set of technical and procedural security controls that will help reduce the risks of mishandled information. 

Data that is not yet classified should be considered restricted until the data steward assigns an appropriate classification. 

The classification of data is independent of its format. Video of interactions with patients in clinics would be considered HIPAA protected information. Paper copies of information that is considered restricted should be handled with appropriate protections. 

If you have questions about the classification or handling of data should be directed to the appropriate data steward, supervisor, departmental security liaison, or the ITS security office. Departmental security liaisons, in coordination with the ITS security office, can assist departments in developing appropriate controls and processes to protect Sensitive or Restricted data. 

Data Classification 

Definition 

Examples 

Sensitive 

(High) 

Sensitive data is the highest data classification category at the University of Akron. It is reserved for information that is either required by law or regulation to protect, or that the university has deemed critical to protect to reduce risk to the institution. Explicit approval from the data steward is needed to access, collect, modify, or change sensitive data. Additional protections beyond standard protections for sensitive data may be required by law or regulation. 

Social Security Numbers 

Credit Card Numbers 

PHI (HIPAA protected data) 

FERPA (Non-directory information) 

Prospective student data 

Donor Data 

CUI (Controlled unclassified information 

HR Data 

Research data 

Restricted 

(Medium) 

Restricted information is the default classification category. Restricted information is not intended for public consumption but does not fit into the sensitive category. Disclosure of restricted information would not significantly harm the university. Access to restricted data is determined by business process need. 

Anything not public or sensitive. 

Data whose access is restricted to certain groups or departments on campus. 

Other research data not considered sensitive or public. 

Financial transactions 

NDA data 

Public 

(Low) 

Public data is data that is intended to be made available to the general public or is approved for publication. 

Public facing websites 

Campus maps 

FERPA directory data* 

Faculty/staff directory data 

Research data 

 

Roles and Responsibilities 

To ensure proper information handling, University of Akron students, faculty, and staff need to be aware of the classification of a piece of information and the risks and procedures involved in the handling of that information. 

 

Data Steward 

The individual or group who has accountability and authority to make decisions about a specific set of data. The data steward is responsible for the function or functions that use the information, determines the levels of protection for the information, makes decisions on appropriate use of the information, and determines the appropriate classification of the information. 

Data Manager 

The persons or unit responsible for implementing the controls the Data Steward identifies. Data managers are responsible for ensuring the appropriate security controls are in place on systems containing sensitive and restricted data. 

Data Users 

Any person who interacts with the data – people or programs that can create, update, read, or delete information. Users are responsible for taking reasonable precautions to preserve the confidentiality of data they have access to. Access to sensitive and restricted data is controlled by the data stewards. 

Campus Units/Departments 

The University of Akron recommends that all campus units that collect and store information document their policies, procedures, and architectures that involve the collection, storage, and analysis of information. This documentation should detail account creation and deletion, records retention and destruction, backup strategies, and other relevant procedures 

 

Sensitive Server Registration 

The University of Akron tracks servers containing sensitive data. Campus departments are asked to document any servers they may have that contain sensitive and restricted data, and update ITS. 

Incident Reporting 

Please report the misuse of or compromise of systems containing sensitive data immediately by emailing security@uakron.edu.
